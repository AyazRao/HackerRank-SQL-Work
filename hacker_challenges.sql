/*
Problem Statement: Challenges (HackerRank)

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name,
and the total number of challenges created by each student.

Exclusion Rule:
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum
number of challenges created (i.e., not the absolute maximum count), then exclude those students from the result.

Sorting Rules:
1. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order.
2. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id in ascending order.

Tables:
- Hackers (hacker_id: Integer, name: String)
- Challenges (challenge_id: Integer, hacker_id: Integer)

Language: MySQL
